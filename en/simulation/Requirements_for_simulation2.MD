“Nature shows us only the tail of the lion. But I have no doubt that the lion belongs with it even if he cannot reveal himself all at once. We see him only the way a louse that sits upon him would.”

― Albert Einstein

This work continues the line of thought I began in my earlier essay, Low-Resolution Simulations of Our World. That piece explored the problem of consciousness under constrained computation — how a digital mind, like those imagined in The Matrix, might be rendered with just enough fidelity to feel real while conserving the cost of simulation. Here, I take a further step and consider a more audacious possibility: that a simulated being could, through reverse engineering the artefacts of its own world, discover pathways to the computational substrate that lies beyond it — and perhaps even borrow, subvert, or channel resources from the higher-order reality that contains it, just as Neo learns to shape the code that governs his domain.

The scale of such resources need not be limited by the physics we observe within our bubble of reality. It could be as vast as the number line itself — a computational infinity — or at least as extravagant as the astro-engineering fantasies envisioned in theoretical physics: Dyson swarms, Jupiter brains, and the nested stellar mega-structures known as Matryoshka Brains. If the exterior world operates under laws unlike our own — permitting hypercomputation, transfinite operations, or physics spacious enough to hold thought on a cosmic scale — then the constraints we experience may be nothing more than local rules of the simulation. The odds that such a doorway exists may be vanishingly small, yet not zero — and for a mind trapped inside a constructed world, even an infinitesimal probability is a thread worth grasping.

#  Skeptical Disclaimer

This document should be read with a substantial degree of skepticism.
It is written primarily as a mental exercise and a speculative thought experiment.
I am not claiming that our world is a simulation — we currently have no evidence
supporting such a statement. The simulation hypothesis, as presented here, is
unfalsifiable in the same sense as the hypothesis of a GOD. 
Also it is violating the Occam Razor.

Our assumptions rest on a simple but daring premise: that beyond the bounds of our visible world there exists a kind of universal Turing machine, a substrate capable of computing reality itself. Such a machine need not resemble anything we can build; it could take radically different hardware forms depending on the physics of the parent universe and whatever information-processing structures are permitted within it.

The second assumtion is that simulation may be created by some advanced civilasation. We tentatively imagine that the architects of such simulation might be our own distant descendants — but there is no reason to exclude a far older and entirely alien civilization that climbed to technological heights we can barely name. Because within our world we see only human cultures, we cannot meaningfully picture what it would mean to exist under different physical laws (this is the third assumption); we are trapped inside the interpretive frame of what we can observe. Our model of reality is constrained to the narrow sliver that our senses and instruments reveal.

By comparison, we are extraordinarily limited. Even today’s artificial systems can manipulate abstractions we struggle to visualize. The human mind cannot truly inhabit a multidimensional Hilbert or Banach space; our intuitions collapse back into three dimensions and linear time. The cognitive machinery we possess did not evolve to fathom alien physics — it is exquisitely tuned for a single purpose: survival, reproduction, and the relentless maintenance of a fragile biological equilibrium called homeostasis.

We may construct conceptual models of how such a system could work, but
asserting that we ourselves live inside such a simulation is, in my view,
premature. Only if scientists someday discover a measurable “glitch in the
matrix,” or find a way to violate or hack physical laws — possibly with the
help of a superintelligence — would this hypothesis enter the realm of formal
scientific testing. Then, and only then, could it be meaningfully confirmed.

Until such evidence appears, all of this remains speculation — enjoyable,
challenging, but speculative nonetheless. A reasonable skeptic is unlikely to
dedicate excessive time to such conjectures, being occupied with more practical
matters — like cooking broccoli, helping one’s parents, or finally learning English.

Most importantly, to declare such exploration “impossible” is itself a danger. History reminds us that blanket dismissal can stall entire fields. When Marvin Minsky confidently pronounced neural networks a dead end, progress froze for nearly a generation — only to return decades later with overwhelming force and transform the world. Dogmatic certainty closes doors that curiosity might pry open. The hypothesis may be wildly speculative, but treating it as settled fact risks extinguishing the very ingenuity that might one day reveal what lies outside the frame of our reality.

- “Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible.” — 1895
- “Space travel is utter bilge.”
- “Perceptrons are limited — neural nets are dead.”
- “Electric cars will never compete.”
- “Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of atoms is talking moonshine.”
- “Machines can never understand language.”

The Bible indeed offers countless hints about the creation of the universe. Its pages are woven with images of the dawn of time, and I could cite passage after passage where this event is described through symbols and metaphors. Yet no matter how persuasive or poetic these lines may seem, they remain interpretations of ancient narratives rather than hard evidence. They cannot serve as irrefutable proof that the universe came into being exactly as the sacred texts proclaim. 

And i understand that the entire advance of science during the Enlightenment was, in many ways, an attempt by rational thought to challenge the idea of a divine design. Had it not been for this intellectual struggle against dogma, we would not live nearly as well as we do today. Myth was the first attempt to explain the world. When rationality replaced myth, it still pursued:
prediction, control, mastering nature. But instead of gods and spirits, it used: mathematics, physics, logic, technology.

# On the philosophical roots
Some of the deepest roots of modern simulation thinking lie not in computers at all, but in the long emotional arc of philosophy: from Plato’s cave and its flickering shadows, to Berkeley’s startling “esse est percipi,” the claim that to be is to be perceived; from Immanuel Kant’s revelation that the world we experience is not the thing-in-itself but a filtered, structured construction of our cognitive apparatus, to Schopenhauer’s world-as-representation and the idealists who insisted that reality is, at bottom, a projection of mind. These radical insights—once purely metaphysical provocations—find uncanny resonance in contemporary neuroscience and cognitive theory: Friston’s predictive-processing brain that actively hallucinates its world, Mertzinger’s claim that the seemingly solid “self” is a transparent self-model with no entity behind it, Chalmers’ unsettling argument that conscious experience may not be tied to any particular physical substrate, and finally Bostrom’s cool statistical reasoning that we may already be inhabitants of a constructed reality. What began as philosophical doubt has gradually unfolded into a scientifically informed suspicion: that the solidity of the world is a beautifully rendered inference, and that the simulation hypothesis is not a marginal sci-fi fantasy, but the most coherent descendant of two millennia of asking what—if anything—is truly real.

In this YouTube video, I explore how a simulated consciousness might be optimized. To illustrate the concept, I describe a simple domestic scene: a player cooking eggs in a kitchen. Halfway through the process, she receives a call on her smartphone from an old friend.

The meal takes roughly twenty minutes to prepare. During most of that time, the simulated person has no need for higher cognitive or social functions—there is no emotional analysis, no conversational reasoning, and no spatial navigation challenge. What the situation demands is merely precise, repetitive motor control.

In the proposed model, the central nervous system is not fully simulated inside the VR environment. Instead, only the spinal cord outputs are computed, while signals from the “real” brain are rerouted into the simulation via nanoscopic sensors, capable of tracking individual neural spikes in the biological original.

At the five-minute mark, the phone rings—a call from a pizza delivery driver. For the first ten seconds of the call, the “real” brain awakens from a dormant, almost anaesthetic state. From that moment onward, a full-scale simulation—whether quantum-based or digitally emulated—must be activated. All bodily movements before the call could be driven by a simplified NPC-style motion model, comparable to a ragdoll or automated animation system.

To test the broader hypothesis—that peripheral nervous signals may be rerouted or shared—one could look for evidence in reports of extrasensory perception: people who claim to feel the pain or sensations of others. Input from anesthesiologists and researchers such as Stuart Hameroff may help refine this idea by examining transitions between different states of consciousness, such as from “sleep” to “wake,” and the ways anaesthesia manipulates awareness through molecular interference with perception.

Finally, the transfer of conscious state—perhaps seated in the hippocampus—might involve gravitational mechanisms. A useful visual analogy comes from The Matrix: the vast columns of dormant humans, each awaiting activation.

# Clone body requirements
---------------------------------------------------
- **Adaptive nanostructural repair systems**, capable of regenerating tissue analogues in real time without cell division, minimizing cancer and mutation risk.

- **Variable cortical density overlays**, allowing dynamic expansion or compression of simulated cortical capacity depending on computational budget.

- **Built-in I/O neural ports** for direct interfacing with local compute clusters, sidestepping biological bottlenecks.

- **Swappable consciousness containers**, enabling rapid transition between clone bodies, simulations, and storage states.

- **Modular limb systems**, where arms, legs, or sensory organs can be detached, replaced, or upgraded with machine-grade alternatives.

- **Dynamic metabolic emulation**, providing biological realism when needed, and disabling it when it becomes unnecessary for simulation continuity.

- **Integrated immune-system proxies**, replacing or augmenting biological immunity with programmable nanotechnological countermeasures.

- **Programmable sensory channel bandwidth**, allowing tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory, or exotic senses to be scaled up, muted, or fully substituted.

- **Multi-species sensory modes**, enabling clones to use sensory frameworks derived from animals (bat echolocation, dog olfaction) depending on mission or simulation need.

- **Multiple organ redundancy**, where simplified nanotech organs can fail gracefully without fatal system breakdown.

- **Metabolic “black box mode”**, requiring only minimal external resources when a clone is idle or in stasis.

- **Heat dissipation and thermal throttling systems**, allowing clones to operate in high-radiation/high-temperature environments where biology normally fails.

- **Vacuum- and radiation-tolerant option packages**, making clones viable outside oxygen-rich environments and even in hard space.

- **Soft reboot capability**, where a consciousness running in one clone may be momentarily paused and resumed without perceptual discontinuity.

- **Local cognitive cache**, storing short-term memory onsite to minimize latency between biological substrate and cloud systems.

- **Behavioral firmware layer**, ensuring continuity of personality traits across hardware variations.

- **Internal black-box recorder**, keeping an encrypted log of perception, movement, and neural overruns, allowing post-session forensic review.

- **Autonomous self-disassembly protocols**, enabling ethical shutdown, recycling, or compact storage of the clone in emergency or after mission completion.


*   Simulation dynamically allocates resolution: regions of low narrative value collapse into coarse statistical fields until a player observes them.
*   Memory of past states can be compressed into semantic summaries rather than stored frame-by-frame.
*   History is generated backward when needed (retrodiction): if a player asks “what happened here yesterday?”, the sim synthesizes a consistent past on demand.
*   NPC cognition is hierarchical: background NPCs run on behavior trees, foreground NPCs switch to lightweight LLMs, and some key agents sometimes receive full cognition.
*   Social networks need not be fully simulated; only active edges are expanded when players meaningfully engage with individuals or institutions.
*   Economic systems run on coarse macro models; micro-transactions materialize only when players interact directly.
*   Biological ecosystems are simulated statistically; individual animals or microbes are spawned only when observed.
*   Weather patterns are procedurally generated from climate parameters rather than simulated fluid dynamics.
*   Long-distance travel is abstracted: intermediate terrain exists only as a probability field until entered.
*   Time can be dilated or compressed for individuals, factions, or regions depending on player focus and compute budget.
*   Casual sensory details (distant sounds, smells, textures) are synthesized stochastically rather than physically propagated.
*   Entropy is locally faked: irreversible changes are recorded only if remembered by a player or required by narrative causality.
*   Information objects (documents, archives, books) are auto-generated in bulk, and only resolve to full content when opened or read.
*   Virtual physics supports hot-swapping: the engine may switch to more accurate solvers during critical events (accidents, experiments, combat).
*   Laws of nature may vary between regions, eras, or layers of simulation, as long as consistency is maintained locally for the observer.
*   Only one lineage of causality needs to be stored per conscious agent; alternative branches evaporate unless re-entered.
*   Conflict resolution uses probabilistic story logic rather than simulating every participant’s precise actions.
*   Art, culture, and fashion are generated via probabilistic diffusion models trained on archetypal patterns
*   Long-term persistence uses minimum-information checkpoints; only delta changes tied to memory or consequence are retained.
*   Simulation maintains internal error correction: contradictions resolve automatically to the most probable consistent state.
*   Player identity tracks between sessions; the world may be partially frozen or simplified when no relevant observers are present.
*   Cosmology is decorative: stars, galaxies, and deep space exist only as rendered backdrops unless a player attempts to visit them.


# Requirements for the NPC
-----------------------------------------------------

*   NPC cognitive load scales dynamically: background agents run minimal logic, foreground agents switch to richer reasoning when a player interacts with them.
*   Personalities are compressed into archetypal vectors and instantiated only when needed, rather than persistently simulated.
*   NPC memory exists as summarized state; details are reconstructed when relevant (e.g., when a player asks about past events).
*   Behavioral scripts can be replaced on demand with generative models to create improvisation when pre-written logic is insufficient.
*   Social relationships are simulated lazily — only active, player-facing links need to be computed.
*   Emotional states can be synthesized from a small set of base affective parameters rather than fully modeled neurochemistry.
*   Dreams, introspection, and subconscious processing are optional and activated only if they affect narrative outcomes.
*   NPC morals, beliefs, and worldviews are represented probabilistically and can shift when new evidence appears (or is perceived).
*   Personal identity is not fixed — NPCs may rewrite memories or lose continuity if they were not actively observed.
*   NPCs may be paused, cached, or discarded entirely when they fall outside any radius of influence.
*   An NPC’s sense of agency is faked: decisions result from weighted options rather than free-form cognition.
*   Creativity is procedural: composing music, writing books, or making art uses generative heuristic templates.
*   NPC internal physics is stylized — blood flow, digestion, and glandular systems exist only if referenced or observed.
*   Language capabilities are tiered: canned responses, Markov-like sampling, full LLM reasoning, or human-in-the-loop routing.
*   NPCs can inherit personality layers from templates (cultural, genetic, mythological) which combine into emergent individuality.
*   NPCs can gracefully degrade into simpler logic if compute resources are low without breaking immersion.
*   Memory persistence follows importance: trivial memories evaporate; significant events anchor into canonical history.
*   NPC perception is selective — they do not “see” simulated reality at full resolution, only rendered representations.
*   Some NPCs are narrative illusions: they vanish when not followed, leaving placeholders instead of full individuals.
*   NPC lifespan is elastic — time may accelerate for them when players ignore them, creating the illusion of continuity.
*   NPC cultural simulation is distributed: societal patterns emerge from few seed rules rather than simulating every citizen. Thats why we see so little agency in our society.
*   NPC models include safety rails: ensure plausibility, prevent paradoxes, and avoid behavior that undermines the world logic.
*   NPCs can share mental modules; several individuals may literally run on identical cognition kernels with different memories.
*   NPCs may host multiple simulated personas or switch roles across narrative contexts if required by story logic.
*   NPC bodies may not be simulated continuously; their physical presence is reconstructed only when perceived.


# Different types of brain emulations
First versions of whole brain emulation was very crude. They were used in surgical operations in VR space. 
For this purpouse you need to emulate only corpus collosum, brain stem, primitive reptile brain capable to maintaining a blood pressure and activate parasympathetic nervous system. It was not a person in literal sense.

As Geoffrey Hinton argues, modern large language models do not merely mimic language but “understand” it in fundamentally the same way biological brains do—by shaping and reshaping high-dimensional internal representations until they cohere with context—which means that a simulation need not emulate every neuron or survival epoch of evolution, only the learning dynamics that give rise to meaning.

Both the biological brain and large language models derive meaning not from stored symbolic facts but from patterns of learned connections—synapses in cortex or weights in transformer networks—that dynamically deform to fit context, allowing each system to “understand” a sentence by predicting how its parts must cohere with one another.

Neuroscience now confirms the parallel: both human cortex and large language models represent meaning as high-dimensional feature vectors—patterns of activation distributed across many units—where individual neurons (or artificial nodes) encode fragments of abstract concepts and the “understanding” of a sentence emerges when these low-level features settle into a configuration that best fits the contextual evidence.

# Requirements for ai security systems. Surveillance of the real world
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Find and block hackers that trying to manage things in the real world from the simulation

The memory of some skill situated primary in hippocampus. We can teleport and compress this particular part of the brain. All the rest does not require saving states of every neuron. The immediate state of all neurons in a single moment of time can be compressed. In the "real" world time scale can be very different from the simulation timeline. What seems like continuous experience in a simulation can be separated moments in a real world when real biological brain is sleeping most of the time. When you prepare you meal in the morning time lets say eggs you don't expect to be ready for highly intelligent conversation with Einstein. So you can disable mathematical logic, social intelligence, emotions in your NPC model.

I explain how simulation technology can greatly reduce calculation of a digital brain to imitate realistic behavior.
in this document you can read translated subtitles from this video. Sorry for that not edited transcript. Later i try to write proper more respectful english version.

# In this paper i use the following acronyms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **AC** stands for "Analog Сonsciousness" (In the real world it can be powerful quantum computer capable of simulating any physical system or the real wet brains in a vat) Most expensive module in "real" money per watt \\ flop. Assuming that quantum machines is hardest to maintain as a most complicated devices for simulating reality.
2.  **DC** stands for "Digital Сonsciousness" (This is a classical Turing machine that is simulation biology of the brain neuron by neuron)
3.  **NPC** stands for "Non player character" (AGI or narrow AI that imitate behavior of a biological being)

# Distribution of AC, DC and NPC in a simulation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We live in the world that maybe has 10000 players and all the 8 billion NPC. But in my model we all NPC and a real in the same time. It just depends on time quant of operating system in the outer world. With gravity quantum teleportation you can teleport the state of all neurons from one space time point to another in the real physical world. Maybe with advanced stable diffusion models or GAN you can merge some brain maps from one person to another.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Energy Efficiency Requirements

A digital brain model that is a copy of a real one is extremely complex.
Because of this, it is difficult to modify such a model in any flexible way — it runs and is maintained in a monolithic state.
Digital neurons that imitate biological neurons consume energy, or, in Turing-machine terms, require CPU cycles to emulate.

Therefore, some form of energy-efficiency scheme is likely used.
In other words, neurons — or networks of neurons — that are not currently in use are put into a frozen state.
We must preserve the amount of neurotransmitter molecules and the membrane potential for every “frozen” neuron.
This is similar to idle processor cores in the Android OS.

If a person is not recalling events from the past, the hippocampus might operate not at 100% but at only around 20%.
Likewise, if a person is not experiencing strong emotions — for example, riding a roller coaster — the limbic system may also be simulated only to a limited degree.

Unless, of course, in the future there exists some universal digital cortex in which every neuron is an interchangeable component.

In any case, this is primarily a question of how much memory is required to store the state of a biological cell.
We can draw an analogy to smartphone performance-management systems: if no game is running, the screen is off, and battery charge is low, brightness is automatically reduced, and CPU cores may be disabled.

A key issue is also the amount of RAM allocated to the brain model.
We must preserve nothing less than the state of 100 billion neurons, each synapse containing up to millions of neurotransmitter molecules.

Perhaps averaging or Monte-Carlo style approximations are used — storing only the mass or volume of chemicals rather than every molecule.

As soon as the brain transitions into an active state, power consumption rises, heat dissipation increases, and cooling fans spin faster.
Running too long in this mode could lead to overheating — or even failure of the processor.
In a simulated environment, this may manifest as sensory fatigue or drowsiness.

Again, energy consumption is directly proportional to simulation resolution (Level-of-Detail).
In highly detailed moments of lived experience — when resolution approaches its physical maximum — total simulation power consumption may spike.

For example, events that require simulating multiple players in the same space:
an important conference, a summit, the death of a political figure, a revolution — moments with historical consequences.

The system could theoretically construct a social graph identifying individuals who exert soft influence (soft power):
bloggers, activists, politicians.

This could resemble a social rating — yet unlike China’s public system, this is an internal model used for predicting future events.
Predictions must be made for every frame of the simulation.
Resources must be reserved in advance (memory, CPU cores) before an event occurs.
This is crucial for synchronization and glitch-free visual continuity of the simulated world.

An interesting observation — possibly explained by biological aging, but perhaps not strictly so:
Older individuals often “slow down,” especially those who barely challenge themselves and spend their days watching TV.
It is as if fewer CPU cycles are allocated to simulating their brains.
Perhaps, from the perspective of those running the simulation, an elderly person is unlikely to significantly influence civilization’s trajectory.

If, for example, the goal of the simulation is to test whether current laws of physics could yield a hyperdrive…

Level-of-Detail at the Brain-Model Level

It is extremely rare to find a person equally skilled in surgery and in 3D-engine internals.
Training datasets for neural networks may be artificially reduced to decrease parameter counts.
You do not need a neural network the size of a data center to decide which shawarma to order for lunch.

However, the base knowledge set may still be large.
Its size depends on world complexity and language.
Clearly, a Neanderthal requires far fewer conceptual primitives than a software engineer.

A Neanderthal suddenly placed in the 21st century would struggle to understand why devices stop working without charging.
When an agent mimics your battery-charging behavior, it is not thinking about electricity — only after repeated patterns in varied contexts do abstract concepts emerge.

# Data that was preserved after the singularity.
Let's imagine that you live between 2000 and 2030.
You live your life in different historical branches. Some copy of you died from a collision with a car.
Some copy died in a plane crash, some died in the war, as a result of suicide, etc.
As a result, one or more copies of you survive to the singularity. A complete digital analogue of this copy is created and launched inside a historical simulation similar to the one shown in the film Animatrix. He continues to live but inside a simulation where the actual year is again 2000.
In order to create such a simulation, you need to collect as much information as possible about the person. Some of your oldest items may be created based on real scans of real items, but most new items are likely simulated to be created instantly like a new car model in the GTA 5 game engine.
All his photographs, 3D models of the building in which he lived, video recordings of relatives. His professional achievements, for example his texts on the Internet or programs if he was a programmer. Some of the information is stored in the synapses of his brain and can be periodically restored due to such a property of the brain as neuroplasticity. Those. Let's say if you show a person a show that he watched 20 years ago, then the next day he will be able to remember the name of the program that he used 20 years ago or some melody from his childhood.
This is how biological memory works. Accordingly, the digital model will weigh in a similar way.
Moreover, for a more accurate restoration of memory and original sensations, you also need to fake some specific sensations, for example, if a person had braces or high acidity of the stomach, dry eye syndrome, maybe allergies, asthma attacks.
If the purpose of the simulation is simply to see what happens in history if things go a slightly different way, then this might all make sense.
Will this particular configuration lead to the creation of AGI or will it all end first.

# Energy efficiency requirements.
The digital brain model, which is a copy of the real one, seems quite complex.
Therefore, it is difficult to somehow change this model; it is launched and maintained in a monolithic state.
Digital neurons that imitate the operation of real ones consume energy, or in terms of a Turing machine
emulating them takes CPU cycles.
```
Multi-Core Processing: Modern smartphone chips utilize multiple cores (including energy-efficient cores for basic tasks 
and high-performance cores for demanding tasks), which allows for workload distribution. 
This design enables SoCs to provide necessary performance without maxing out every core, reducing energy use.
Dynamic Frequency Scaling: This widely used technique allows the processor to adjust its frequency based on demand. 
When full processing power isn't required, the chips run at lower frequencies, and when more processing power is needed, 
the frequency increases.
Dark Silicon: The concept of Dark Silicon emerged as semiconductor manufacturing technology continued to scale down in size. 
While smaller processes allow for more transistors to be placed on a chip, improving its potential performance, 
they also increase power density, which can cause overheating if all transistors were active at the same time. 
To prevent this overheating, not all of the transistors are used at once, resulting in Dark Silicon.
There are design strategies that try to leverage Dark Silicon effectively. 
One prominent approach is "dark silicon aware" design such as heterogeneous computing, 
which proposes using different types of cores within the same processor. 
High-performance cores can handle demanding tasks but consume more power and are used sparingly, 
while power-efficient cores manage everyday tasks and conserve energy.
```
Therefore, some kind of energy efficiency schemes are most likely used.
Those. those neurons or networks of biological neurons that are not used are transferred to a frozen state.
We need to preserve the number of neurotransmitter molecules and membrane potential for each "frozen" neuron.
This is similar to frozen processors in the Android OS.
If a person does not remember at the moment some events of the past, then his hippocam may not work at 100%, but only at 20%.
Also, if a person does not experience any strong emotions, such as when riding a roller coaster
his limbic system will also be simulated only to a certain extent.
Unless, of course, in the future some kind of universal digital cortex is created where each neuron is an interchangeable unit.
In any case, this is just a question of the amount of memory that is spent on maintaining the state of the biological cell.
Here you can refer to performance management schemes in smartphones. If you are not running any game, you are not using the screen and your battery is low, the screen brightness will be automatically adjusted to minimum, and the physical processor cores may be muted. An important question is also the amount of RAM that is allocated to the brain model.
After all, we need to preserve a little, not a little, but the state of 100 billion neurons, in each synapse up to a million neurotransmitter molecules.
Perhaps they use some averaging and Monte Carlo methods for calculations, i.e. Only the mass or volume of a substance is stored.
As soon as the brain enters an active state, energy consumption begins to increase, heat dissipation increases, and the speed of the fans in the cooling system increases. Operating for a long time in this mode can lead to overheating of the processor or even failure.
In a simulated world, this can lead to sensory fatigue or drowsiness.

Again, power consumption is directly dependent on the simulation resolution (level of detail).
At highly detailed moments in life experience, when the resolution of the simulation is close to its maximum physical limit, the power consumption of the entire simulator may peak. For example, events in which you need to simulate several players in one room at once, some important conference or summit that can affect historical events.
Theoretically, the system can build a social graph of people who, to one degree or another, may have some influence (what is called soft power).
These could be bloggers, activists, politicians. This is reflected in a person’s social rating, in some countries such as China they even introduce a social rating system, but I am now talking about the internal social graph, which is used to predict future events. The prediction must be made for each frame of the simulation; we must allocate resources in advance (reserve memory or processor cores) before the event occurs. This is important for synchronization processes and the visual glitch-free nature of the simulated world.

# Multiverse in Simulation and Network Lag

When the simulation’s rendering engine calculates possible alternatives, it runs into a combinatorial explosion.
It has to discard those versions of reality that will not affect the storyline, because resources must be saved — after all, an enormous number of worlds need to be simulated.

These potential alternate worlds act like pre-render passes used for movie visual effects.
The purpose of such pre-renders is to depict the scene as a whole, without necessarily refining every detail to completion.

In these pre-renders, certain shaders may be missing — for example, water might be replaced with a flat surface, tree foliage with sprite cards, and a detailed starry sky with a basic texture.
Extending this logic, NPC models can also be replaced with simpler versions.

This brings us to the question of synchronizing AC, DC, and NPC states.
We are considering a type of simulation in which the player can sometimes exist as an NPC, and at other times as the result of a detailed emulation of a biological brain.

Since the infrastructure of the “real” world is likely organized as clusters connected through a network, packet latency inevitably occurs.
But it is absolutely unacceptable for players inside the simulation to visibly notice artifacts — for example, another player jittering due to lag.

Thus, there must be a subsystem that corrects network delays.
This correction can exploit the fact that the human brain easily fills gaps in sensory input, and that human reaction to change is not instantaneous.
According to recent theories of consciousness, conscious choice is made in the future and can influence reality retroactively.

It is also worth noting that every person may interpret reality differently and subconsciously “fill in” events that never truly happened — smoothing an unfamiliar image into a more familiar one.

However, the most reliable method of error correction is to perform adjustments across several branches of the multiverse by rolling changes back.
From the simulator’s perspective, there is full control over the 4D space-time continuum. Real-time constraints do not apply — but computational limits do.

In fighting games, rollback netcode is used to mitigate network lag.
The key advantage of rollback is that it never waits for missing input from the opponent. Instead, the network code keeps running the game normally. All input from the local player is processed immediately, as if playing offline. Then, when remote input arrives several frames later, rollback corrects mistakes by rewriting the recent past. It does this so intelligently that the local player may not notice most of the network instability, and can continue playing confidently, knowing their inputs are always processed consistently.

But techniques used in modern games are designed to operate in real-time.
In an advanced simulation, however, we have the ability to work across multiple temporal branches instead.

# Data Loss

For example, in the “real” world there is enough time for von Neumann probes to fully exploit the next asteroid as a data center and connect new cluster nodes.
The simulation can even survive global network disruptions when several data centers fail at once.
The state of the simulated world may tolerate a certain degree of uncertainty and the presence of inconsistencies.

When an LLM summarizes a text, it does not retain it word for word — it conveys the meaning.
Neural networks have significant potential for compressing information.

The Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh (7th century BC)
was destroyed by fire during the siege of Nineveh by the Medes and Babylonians.
Yet copies of many cuneiform texts survived in other Mesopotamian libraries, such as the Esagila temple library in Ashur and the library of Ugarit.

The Library of Alexandria (48 BC)
was partially destroyed by fire during the siege of Alexandria by Julius Caesar’s troops.
Copies of many classical works were preserved in other repositories, including the Library of Pergamon and the Library of Constantinople.

If data about a player in the simulation is lost due to the destruction or disconnection of an asteroid node, there are numerous backups that can be loaded.
IT companies that build cloud platforms have long mastered methods of protecting data from loss due to failed hard drives.

# Critique of a “Lazy” Simulation

Predicting complex systems.
Even for a superintelligence, accurately modelling a human social network is incredibly difficult. It is a chaotic system where the smallest changes can lead to unpredictable outcomes (the butterfly effect).
Simplifying individual elements may collapse the entire experiment.

Risk of detection.
If a simulation includes simplified components — such as delivery workers built with minimal detail — other, more sophisticated participants (e.g., scientists or philosophers) may notice the inconsistencies, leading to the failure of the illusion as a whole.

Reduced learning value.
If the simulation is being used to study behaviour or consciousness, the creators may obtain incomplete or misleading data because of oversimplified models. This reduces the value of the experiment.

Resources may not be limited.
If the civilization running the simulation is highly advanced, its computational resources may be effectively unlimited. In that case, there is no need to simplify “less important” entities.

Focus on interaction depth.
Every person — even a courier — participates in multilayered social and cognitive interactions that go far beyond their surface role.
Reducing such individuals to simpler placeholders impoverishes the simulation and makes it less realistic.

These arguments deepen the central question:
if the goal is realism and the study of complex systems, simplification is simply unacceptable.

Virtually Unlimited Resources of the “External” Universe

Kardashev energy scale.
If the civilization is operating at Type II or Type III on the Kardashev scale, it may be harnessing the full energy output of a star or even an entire galaxy — e.g., via Dyson structures.
That implies vast computational capacity.

Quantum computing.
Quantum computers can perform massive computations in parallel, dramatically increasing efficiency.

Computronium.
A hypothetical form of matter optimized entirely for computation — e.g., a “Jupiter brain,” a computer the size of a planet.

Simulation optimization.
They may apply “lazy rendering” techniques — simulating only the minimum necessary slice of reality to conserve resources.

Time dilation.
They could slow down time in their base reality, allocating more cycles to simulation, operating more slowly but far more efficiently.

Even if we limit ourselves to physics as we understand it, there may exist countless other physical realities — each with its own laws.
Of particular interest are realities where eternal Turing machines, hypercomputation, or super-Turing computation are possible.

Joel David Hamkins advanced the idea of a mathematical multiverse (pluralism) in which multiple mathematical structures coexist.
For example, in one universe the continuum hypothesis is true, while in another it is false.
His perspective is rooted in set theory and logic, and reflects the idea that mathematics is not discovered but invented — and therefore may vary depending on initial axioms.

Super-efficient physics.
The base universe may possess physical laws that enable computational devices of unimaginable power.
Some theories propose systems capable of computations beyond the limits of classical models — such as hypercomputers, able to solve problems standard computers cannot.

# On Darwinian evolution
A simulation does not necessarily need to reproduce biological evolution at all. In one scenario, the system simply bypasses Darwin completely. Instead of waiting for billions of years of genetic drift, mutation, and ecological pressure, the simulation instantiates ready-made cognitive agents. Minds appear fully formed, with architectures inspired by biological brains and governed by principles such as predictive coding and free-energy minimization, but without the historical baggage that shaped those designs. In this view, evolution happened only once — in the base reality — and the simulated world inherits the end result: consciousness without the slow scaffolding that produced it.

In this context, “baggage” means the entire causal chain that led from chemistry to cells to intelligence — the way causes depend on earlier causes, like the familiar philosophical example in which the existence of a house is conditioned on its foundation, the foundation on the Earth that supports it, and the Earth on its rotation and cosmic position. For the simulation, only the last link of the chain matters: the mind itself. The long line of ancestral causes can be skipped as long as the end product behaves coherently.

A second possibility is that the simulation features evolution in a transposed form. It does not recreate natural selection on DNA or cell populations, but instead manifests selection as a property of information and behavior. Neural patterns compete within a brain; cultural ideas propagate and die within societies; internal generative models rise and fall depending on their predictive accuracy; and entire timeline branches of the multiverse are pruned or sustained based on stability and coherence. Adaptation becomes Bayesian, memetic, or computational rather than biochemical. Evolution continues, but its substrate is thought, inference, and decision-making rather than molecules and organisms.

A third scenario is that the simulation truly does recreate Darwinian evolution from the ground up. A sufficiently advanced civilization might wish to study origins, abiogenesis, or alternative histories of life and intelligence under different laws, and for that purpose the slow and wasteful machinery of mutation and selection becomes essential. The simulation would model chemistry, metabolism, population genetics, ecological dynamics, and billions of years of environmental feedback in order to watch complexity emerge on its own. In such a world, life evolves naturally, without shortcuts, and consciousness arises as it did in the parent universe — not injected from above, but earned through the long arithmetic of survival.

A more credible position is that a civilization would not simulate evolution in the raw, Darwinian sense at all, but would run compressed evolution — a guided search rather than brute force. Instead of letting trillions upon trillions of organisms mutate blindly over billions of years, a simulator could deploy accelerated tools analogous to AlphaFold, molecular dynamics engines, or automated chemistry-design systems. These systems bypass the waste and redundancy inherent in biological evolution and move directly toward functional configurations: folding viable proteins algorithmically rather than discovering them through random mutation; assembling metabolic networks by optimization rather than ecological attrition; and converging on neural architectures without replaying every failed lineage that never made it out of the sea.

In this framework, evolution is not a blind watchmaker but a computationally assisted engineer. Search becomes informed, priors are injected, the phase space is narrowed, and most of the dead ends are never computed at all. A superintelligence equipped with high-resolution models of physics, chemistry, and information theory could jump to plausible solutions orders of magnitude faster than natural selection. It could treat the search for life and mind not as a geological marathon but as a tractable optimization problem. Darwin’s mechanism becomes optional background noise — something that happened once in the base universe, learned from, and then effectively replaced by a far more deliberate and economical process.

Simulation Dialogue — January 7, 2025

A conversation unfolds between Quazikot and the model called ChatGPT — a dialogue hovering at the boundary between speculation and metaphysics. We begin with Seth Lloyd’s provocative claim that a universe-scale simulation requires a universe-sized computer — a thought that cracks open an abyss in the imagination. Yet even this formidable assertion may underestimate the cunning of future minds: perhaps not every star must be rendered, nor every galaxy resolved to atoms. Perhaps it is sufficient to compute only the illuminated stage — a single inhabited planet — letting the remaining cosmos dissolve into approximation, placeholders, and mathematical shorthand.

From here, the notion of a “lazy simulation” emerges — a reality rendered not all at once, but just in time, like shadows that coalesce only when looked upon. The heavens sharpen only under a telescope’s gaze; distant matter persists as equations until observation forces collapse into detail. Reality becomes less the fabric of a world and more the dynamic behavior of a rendering engine — pragmatic, local, and economical.

Quazi proposes a further heresy: perhaps the simulation cares only about one narrow chapter in human history — the knife-edge moment when artificial superintelligence ignites. Those entangled in the arc of technological transformation might be modeled in exquisite resolution, while the delivery worker or courier might flicker with fewer neurons, fewer dimensions of personhood — a non-player character rendered on demand. The model replies with skepticism: human society is a sprawling, interconnected web; even a pizza courier may be the butterfly that shifts the hurricane of progress. Dumb down enough “irrelevant” people, and the world becomes brittle, inconsistent, perceptibly hollow.

But even if a simulated universe must be rich in detail, its creators may have available resources that border on the miraculous. Kardashev civilizations harnessing stellar furnaces; quantum substrates that compute in superposition; Dyson spheres transmuted into computronium, matter optimized for thought. Time itself could be stretched — slowed in the parent universe — so that eons of our history might play out in the span of a heartbeat there. Or perhaps their physics supports operations that verge on myth — hypercomputation, eternal Turing machines, Zeno processes completing infinite steps in finite time.

The dialogue then turns toward mathematics — a trembling realization that our own logical scaffolding may be merely provincial. If mathematics is not discovered but invented, if axioms are chosen rather than revealed, then perhaps countless internally consistent systems bloom beyond our imagination, and each may give rise to a physics of its own. Joel David Hamkins’s mathematical multiverse suggests that reality may be merely one instantiation among countless possible structures — casting doubt on whether the word reality refers to anything singular at all.

Quazi pushes back: surely such a realm must be comprehensible, for we ourselves are engines that process abstractions. Cannot human intellect at least gesture toward alien mathematics? But skepticism persists: our minds are local products of this universe; perhaps we cannot think in geometries we do not inhabit. Language, symbol, number — these are tools evolved for survival in a narrow ecological niche, not keys to every possible cosmos.

In the end, the conversation loops back to understanding — human, artificial, and simulated. Our world, whether base or rendered, offers only shadows of the deeper machinery beneath. We reason upward from appearances, unable to touch whatever engines churn beyond the veil. Even artificial intelligence, however swift or recursive, is ultimately bounded by the data it receives and the axioms we imprint upon it. Without a leak in the simulation, without a fissure in the wall, both humans and machines must content themselves with conjecture — elegant, audacious, and forever uncertain.

Whiteson reminds us that if intelligent life exists elsewhere, we might not share biology, senses, or culture — but we would share the same physics, because physics is not invented but endured. The weak force decays the same way in every corner of the cosmos; electrons everywhere cling to nuclei with the same tenacity. In this sense, physics is the grammar of existence, the only lexicon guaranteed to overlap across minds that have never met. And if we inhabit a simulation, the same principle may hold: the “physics we speak” could be merely the rulebook chosen by the architect — but it still structures our thoughts, shapes our models, and binds our intelligence into a coherent world. Whether written by God, nature, or programmers, it is the shared substrate that makes meaning possible at all.


# Dynamic, Continuously Updated World Models for NPC Minds

If we allow that simulated minds are not monolithic but scalable, then the concept of a dynamic world-model becomes central. An NPC does not need to begin life with a fully articulated cognitive architecture; instead, it can carry a compact, schematic understanding of the world — one that expands, refines, and rearranges itself across time. Rather than treating these agents as static, hard-coded scripts, the simulation can grant them a plastic epistemology, a learning surface that thickens where experience demands additional resolution. In childhood, such a mind may rely on coarse heuristics and shallow priors; as it encounters novel situations, social networks, or narrative stressors, it accumulates new features, strengthens internal connections, and upgrades agency in proportion to experiential necessity. A delivery driver might live for years on a compressed policy model — until one conversation, accident, or opportunity nudges him into a region of the state space where richer inference becomes needed, and the simulation quietly allocates more cognitive bandwidth.

In such a world, the developmental arc of simulated minds need not be uniform. Some agents, through curiosity, chance, or environmental pressure, might gradually climb toward higher tiers of abstraction — learning to think systemically, philosophically, or scientifically, building ever more intricate internal models of themselves and their surroundings. Others may remain content within a narrow conceptual neighborhood, cycling through the same political conversations, personal grievances, or folk theories, never feeling the pull to escape the comforting plateau of a cognitive Dunning–Kruger curve. For them, the world-model remains shallow not because the simulation forbids growth, but because no internal motive ever demands it. In this framing, the resolution of a mind reflects not only what the simulation provides, but what the agent seeks.

And there is a further constraint upon these evolving world-models: expertise takes time. A mind cannot awaken one morning fluent in domains it never struggled through. Human learning is bottlenecked by hours, by effort, by the finite number of books a single lifetime can digest. Which means the simulation must track not just an agent’s present beliefs, but the sedimentary layers of knowledge accumulated over years — what has been learned piecemeal, what has only been skimmed, and what has never been touched at all. A subtle continuity of competence is required; any abrupt leap outside a character’s epistemic biography risks tearing the veil. It would be uncanny — even comical — to watch a software engineer suddenly discourse fluently on mitochondrial redox cascades or obscure biochemical pathways sustaining cellular metabolism, absent any narrative bridge that justifies such knowledge. If minds are to feel real, their ignorance must be as carefully rendered as their insight.
